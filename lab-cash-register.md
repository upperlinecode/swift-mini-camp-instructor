##Cash Register

######Task
Open up the Xcode playground [here](https://github.com/upperlinecode/intro-to-swift/tree/master/day-1/CashRegister.playground). Follow the instructions at the top of the page to create a cash register that will calculate the price of a purchase of apples.
  - A purchase of less than 5 apples costs 50 cents per apple.
  - A purchase of between 6 and 24 apples costs 40 cents per apple.
  - Any purchase of more than 25 apples costs a flat fee of $10.00


######Bonus
Create a new conditional statement below in the next section. Add an additional branch to the new conditional statement that removes 10% of the cost if the variable onSale is true.

######Double Bonus
Add logic to a new conditional statement to handle an additional kind of fruit: oranges.
  - A purchase of less than 10 oranges costs 80 cents per orange. 
  - A purchase of between 11 and 20 oranges costs 60 cents per orange. 
  - Any purchase of more than 20 oranges costs a flat fee of $12.00

######Triple Bonus
Add a variable so that the user can input the amount of money that they are paying, and print a message letting them know how much change they are getting back. Add in any other features that you think are missing!
