//In order to help out in the checkout line, we're going to write a program to calculate the price of apples at a store. 
//A purchase of less than 5 apples costs 50 cents per apple. A purchase of between 6 and 24 apples costs 40 cents per apple. 
//Any purchase of more than 25 apples costs a flat fee of $10.00"


var pricePerApple: Double = 0.0

var numberOfItems: Int // = set this to different values to test the conditional

var totalCost: Double

//write conditional statement here to calculate the correct total cost







//print a message to the customer telling them the total cost of their purchase
message // = ___
print(message)








//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Bonus
//Add an additional branch to the conditional statement that removes 10% of the cost if onSale is true

var onSale: Bool // = set this to either true or false

numberOfItems // = set this to different values to test the conditional


//write your new conditional statement here









//print a message to the customer telling them the total cost of their purchase
message // = ___
print(message)



//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Double Bonus
//Oranges are also available at the store. Add some code to your conditional so that it can handle the additional item. 
//A purchase of less than 10 oranges costs 80 cents per orange. A purchase of between 11 and 20 oranges costs 60 cents 
//per orange. Any purchase of more than 20 oranges costs a flat fee of $12.00"

var item: String // = add either apple or orange here
var pricePerOrange: Double = 0.0 

numberOfItems // = set this to different values to test the conditional


//write your new conditional statement here








//print a message to the customer telling them the total cost of their purchase
message // = ___
print(message)






//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Final Challenge: add a variable so that the user can input the amount of money that they are paying, and print a 
//message letting them know how much change they are getting back. Add in any other features that you think are missing!
