###Practicing Math with Swift
- We're going to put what we've learned about variables and data types into practice. We're going to build a calculator that works almost exactly like the one on your phone.

- First, download [CalculatorLab.playground](https://github.com/upperlinecode/intro-to-swift/tree/master/day-1/CalculatorLab.playground)

- Follow the directions in the comments to complete the calculator's functions.

- If you are trying to concatenate a string with your variables and getting an error, check out this stackoverflow post:

- Swift can do much more than add, subtract, multiply, and divide. We can import, or include, new math functions in our playground by adding this to the top of your file.
```swift
import Darwin
```

- Take a look at this blog: http://excode.io/code/11/built-in-math/swift. There are lots of examples of mathmatical functions that Swift can now carry out, like sqrt(), log(), and sin().
